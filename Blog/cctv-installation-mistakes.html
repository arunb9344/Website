        <p>Setting up a CCTV camera in Chennai for your home or business is a smart investment in security. However, mistakes during CCTV camera installation in Chennai can lead to gaps in coverage or system failures. EyeTech Securities, an authorized CCTV dealer in Chennai and Hikvision dealer in Chennai, has extensive experience helping clients avoid these pitfalls. In this guide, we outline the top five mistakes to watch out for when installing a home security camera in Chennai or a surveillance camera in Chennai, and how our expertise as a CCTV camera service provider in Chennai can ensure a flawless setup.</p>

        <h2>1. Incorrect Camera Placement</h2>
        <p>Placing cameras in the wrong locations is a common error during CCTV camera installation in Chennai. Cameras that are too high, too low, or obstructed by objects like plants or signs fail to capture critical footage. In Chennaiâ€™s urban settings, factors like streetlights or reflective surfaces can also cause glare, reducing visibility.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Conduct a thorough site assessment with a professional CCTV camera service provider in Chennai. EyeTech Securities ensures cameras are strategically placed at entry points, parking areas, and key zones, optimizing coverage and minimizing blind spots.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Selecting Inappropriate Camera Types</h2>
        <p>Choosing the wrong type of CCTV camera in Chennai for your environment can compromise performance. For instance, installing a dome camera in an outdoor area exposed to rain or a bullet camera in a discreet indoor setting may lead to suboptimal results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Partner with an authorized CCTV dealer in Chennai, like EyeTech Securities, a trusted Hikvision dealer in Chennai. We recommend weatherproof bullet cameras for outdoor surveillance, discreet dome cameras for indoor use, and PTZ cameras for large areas requiring flexible monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Underestimating Storage Needs</h2>
        <p>Failing to plan for adequate storage is a frequent mistake when installing a surveillance camera in Chennai. High-resolution cameras and continuous recording require significant storage capacity, and insufficient space can lead to lost footage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Estimate storage requirements based on resolution, frame rate, and desired recording duration. EyeTech Securities offers Hikvision DVR/NVR systems tailored to your needs, ensuring your footage is securely stored for as long as you need it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Neglecting Remote Access Configuration</h2>
        <p>A modern home security camera in Chennai should provide remote access via mobile apps or web browsers for real-time monitoring. Skipping this setup limits your ability to check your property on the go, especially in a dynamic city like Chennai.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Opt for IP cameras with remote access features and ensure proper network configuration during CCTV camera installation in Chennai. EyeTech Securities sets up seamless mobile access, allowing you to monitor your system from anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Omitting Power Backup</h2>
        <p>Power outages can disrupt your surveillance camera in Chennai, leaving your property vulnerable. Without a backup power source, your CCTV system may fail during critical moments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Install an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to keep your system running during outages. EyeTech Securities, a leading CCTV camera service provider in Chennai, includes power backup solutions in our installation plans for uninterrupted security.</li>
        </ul>
